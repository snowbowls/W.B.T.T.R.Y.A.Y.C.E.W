## General Introduction

As more businesses and governments adopt information and communication technologies into their infrastructure, the need for proper security becomes increasingly more important. All employees working adjacent to these technologies must be made aware how their actions can affect how secure a system truly is. Cybersecurity is described as the technologies and practices to protect people and data from an attack through unauthorized access. It’s important for any individual who interacts with these networked technologies to be made aware how it can be used against them or give unauthorized access to attackers. Cybersecurity training can be effective by increasing the awareness of the security risks and teaching individuals how to navigate these risk to protect themselves and the organization from cyber threats. The effectiveness of training can depend on the relevance of the training, the frequency of training, and of course the quality of the training program.

How does providing ongoing cybersecurity education and training to employees impact an organization's overall security?

Methods for training:

Awareness programs (CSA): These programs often include training sessions where employees are given information about the latest security threats and best practices for protecting their networks from cyber threats. This can be delivered through live training sessions, webinars, or online resources.

Gamification: This can help employees better understand and remember key concepts, as well as providing a low-stakes environment to practice safe online behavior. Simulated phishing exercises work by sending employees simulated phishing emails that mimic real attacks. The goal of these exercises is to train employees to recognize and avoid these types of threats in the future. The simulated phishing emails often contain links or attachments that, when clicked, will trigger an alert to inform the employee that they have fallen for a simulated phishing attack. The employee will then receive feedback and education on how to avoid falling for similar attacks in the future.

Methods for testing effectivness:

Training Assessment: Determine the level of understanding for cybersecurity concepts and the best practices before and after the training. This can involve monitoring employees' actions, such as their compliance with security policies and procedures.

Simulate incident response plans: This can involve conducting simulated security breaches to determine how well employees respond to such incidents and to measure their understanding of the response procedures. This can also include measuring their technical skills such as the employee’s ability to identify and mitigate potential threats and vulnerabilities.

Trainee Feedback: Gathering feedback from employees about their training, its content and how it was delivered, as well as the overall effectiveness that can provide valuable insights for future improvements.
