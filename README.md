## General Introduction

As more businesses and governments adopt advancing information and communication technologies into their infrastructure, the need for proper security training becomes increasingly more important. All employees working adjacent to these technologies must be made aware how their actions can affect how secure a system truly is. Cybersecurity is described as the technologies and practices to protect people and data from an attack through unauthorized access. It’s important for any individual who interacts with these networked technologies to be made aware how it can be used against them or give unauthorized access to attackers. Cybersecurity training can be effective by increasing the awareness of the security risks and teaching individuals how to navigate these risk to protect themselves and the organization from cyber threats. The effectiveness of training can depend on the relevance of the training, the frequency of training, and of course the quality of the training program.

How does providing ongoing cybersecurity education and training to employees impact an organization's overall security?

How does an industry professionals perception of the usefulness of cybersecurity training differ from the measurable effectiveness of cybersecurity training? 

Methods for training:

Awareness programs (CSA): These programs often include training sessions where employees are given information about the latest security threats and best practices for protecting their networks from cyber threats. This can be delivered through live training sessions, webinars, or online resources.

Gamification: This can help employees better understand and remember key concepts, as well as providing a low-stakes environment to practice safe online behavior. Simulated phishing exercises work by sending employees simulated phishing emails that mimic real attacks. The goal of these exercises is to train employees to recognize and avoid these types of threats in the future. The simulated phishing emails often contain links or attachments that, when clicked, will trigger an alert to inform the employee that they have fallen for a simulated phishing attack. The employee will then receive feedback and education on how to avoid falling for similar attacks in the future.

Methods for testing effectivness:

Training Assessment: Determine the level of understanding for cybersecurity concepts and the best practices before and after the training. This can involve monitoring employees' actions, such as their compliance with security policies and procedures.

Simulate incident response plans: This can involve conducting simulated security breaches to determine how well employees respond to such incidents and to measure their understanding of the response procedures. This can also include measuring their technical skills such as the employee’s ability to identify and mitigate potential threats and vulnerabilities.

Trainee Feedback: Gathering feedback from employees about their training, its content and how it was delivered, as well as the overall effectiveness that can provide valuable insights for future improvements.

Introduction:

Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting computer systems and networks from unauthorized acces that can lead to theft, damage, and other forms of cyber-attacks. The concept of cybersecuirty is the same as information security but not all cybersecurity attacks are targeting the information stored in the network. The network itself can be damaged, preventing further use until repairs or replacements are made. The defense against cyber-attacks starts with training the personal who engage with any network-connected system. The process of educating individuals and organizations on the best practices and techniques for protecting their digital assets from cyber threats. Cybersecurity training covers a wide spectrum of topics from the principles of information security, cyber threat intelligence for future mitigation, vulnerability management, incident response and the compliance of standards. The intent of cybersecuirty training is to improve the knowledge, skills, and awareness of individuals to enhance their ability to detect, prevent, and respond to a cyber threat (de Bruijn, 2017; Paulsen, 2012).

Overview:

(Remove following paragraph..?)
Cybersecurity has been a topic of discussion since the development of early computer systems in the 50s and 60s, the difference in the beginning of this discussion was their focus on physical security such as gaining unauthorized physical access to the hardware itself as opposed to remote network access. As network technology evolved creating more convenient methods of access, so did the vulnerability from cyber threats. The first computer viruses were developed in the early 80s and only then did security research begin developing counter measures to cyber threats such as antivirus software. This trend picked up speed well into the 90s when the rise of the internet and it’s widespread adoption created new opportunities for any individual to engage in cybercrimes such as hacking and identity theft. Today, cyber-attacks have continued to evolve and increase in complexity with a new rise to advanced persistent threats that lay dormant in one’s network until triggered by an event such as a specified time. The demand for effective cybersecurity training will only increase as information security has become a critical concern for any individual including business and governments with the looming threats of ransomware attacks and data leaks.

Modern cybersecuirty training involves different approaches such as simulations, virtual environments, and awareness of best practices with the most common implantation being online training (Leah, 2021). The online-training apporach is a cost-effective and flexible method for providing individuals with access to a wide range of videos, reading passages, and interactive modules structured to test a user’s ability to detect and respond to a cyber threat. The flexibility of online training affords a self-paced learning environment that can be accessed from any location. Regular training and assessment can ensure an individual’s skills are meeting a given standard to identify and protect against cyber threats. The limitations of this method comes down to the mediums used to present the information, and the lack of engaging interactions or hands-on experience such as penetration testing and vulnerability assessment can prevent a trainee from adopting the learned practices. Especially for some individuals where this method is much less effective, extra guidance or more pratical interactions are needed for understanding complex topics.

Technology integrations have expanded how learners engage with learning activitiers where it would usually take place in a classroom. Cloud-based learning is a structured learning curriculum where the learner gains their knowledge and skills in a virtual environment whether it be lecture based or activity focused. This training method aims to expand the classroom experience without giving up on real-time interactions with instructors and experts that you would get in a face-to-face interaction. While classrooms are expensive and time consuming, it may also not be suitable for all types of learners without the integration of hands-on learning in virtual environments. Cloud-based learning offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for trainees to engage in virtual environments to provide a safe and secure platform for learners to apply their knowledge and skills gained from training and learn from their mistakes without impacting the vulnerability of a sensitive network.

(Machine learning or AI related training methods?)

There’s limitations with the integration of the aforementioned technologies and that comes down to the lack of standardization and the need for more practical training. Without standardization, inconsistencies in a learners knowledge and skills can make or break their incident response effectiveness. Practical training is thought to be a solution to provide proper standardization of learning methods and techniques but the barrier for entry can be very high for entry-level learners due to pricing and accessibility of the required technology. Integrating emerging technologies such as extended reality or machine learning can help to facilitate practical training to ensure a more consistent response to real-world scenarios.

## Methods

Operational Definitions:

Cybersecurity - Knowledge and awareness of signs and countermeasures against cyber threats, in the context of phishing attacks. 

Training - The education, instruction, or discipline of a person or thing that is being trained. (reword?)

Phishing - Cyber attack directed at key individuals or large groups by disguising a malicious attack as a reputable organization or entity. 

Perceived Usefulness - A subjective opinion if cybersecurity is effective

Effectiveness - A metric to determine if cybersecurity training is successful 

Industry professional - A person that works in a corporate environment 


Research Design:

In the context of cybersecurity training, a case study can provide valuable insights on the training process and the impact it has on the trainee or organzation. We aim to explore the training experiences of a specfic organzation's method for cybersecurity training, examine their methods for delivering this training, the content that is covered, and the outcomes they expect to achieve versus what is acheieved. Through this examination, our case study also aims to identify the quality of the content presented in training, the engagement of the trainees and the extent to which the training can be integrated into an organziation's security culture.


Participants:

The participants we are interested in for our study are industry professionals that are currently in the workforce. We are defining an industry professional as an individual who works in a corporate office environment. They would be familiar with cybersecurity trainings but will not have above average awareness of cybersecurity. We are looking at a sample size of 30 participants.

Data collection and analysis:

A pretest will be given to the participants before they engage with the learning content for cybersecrity training. This pretest will gather any and all infromation about their expertise on cybersecurity, previous training, how often they engage with networked computers, have they ever been phished before, their perception of cybersecurity training, ...

An interview will be conducted with a mix between open-ended and structured questions to explore their insights, level of understanding of the training content, and to what extent the trainign has infleunced their behavior and decision making.

After engaginge with the learning material, participants will be taken through a short quiz to test their level of understanding and their effectiveness after learning the content. This will provide the data necessary to deterimine the areas that need improvment.

IV - Content of cybersecurity training
DV - Effectiveness and Perceieved Usefullness
